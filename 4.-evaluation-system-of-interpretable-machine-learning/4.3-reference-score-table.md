# 4.3 Reference Score Table

The below score table is a reference score table that is derived from the study that was executed. This is a generic/standard score we would like to hold for the Algorithms and the Methods for reference. It still needs examination to finalize and standardize the score to use it as a reference score table for any reader or user who would like to score their model and make their preferences.

### 4.3.1 Reference Score Table - Interpretable Models/Model-Specific

| Algorithm | Linearity | Monotonicity | Interaction | Parametric | Transparent | Algorithmic complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Logistic Regression | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Generalized Linear | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0.9 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.5 | 0.7 | 0.7 | 1 | 1 | 0.8 |
| XGBoost | 0.1 | 0.4 | 0.7 | 0.9 | 0 | 0.7 |
| Distributed Random Forest | 0.1 | 0.4 | 0.7 | 1 | 0 | 0.9 |
| Deep Learning | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.1 | 0 | 0.2 |
| K-means | 0.1 | 0.8 | 0.1 | 0.7 | 1 | 0.5 |

### 4.3.2 Reference Score Table - Interpretable Models/Model-Specific

| Explanation Method | Feature summary | Model internals | Datapoint | A surrogate intrinsically interpretable model | Expressive power | Portability | Algorithmic complexity | Detailed | Correctness | Consistency | Stability | Certainty | Importance | Novelty | Representativeness |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Variable Importance / Standardized Coefficient | 1 | 1 | 0.5 | / | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0.3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| PDP | 1 | 0.1 | 0.9 | / | 1 | 1 | 0.9 | 0.5 | 1 | 0.8 | 1 | 0.8 | 0.8 | 1 | 0.1 |
| ICE | 1 | 0.2 | 1 | / | 1 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 1 | 1 | 0.8 | 1 | 0.9 | 1 | 0.9 | 0.1 |
| ALE | 1 | 0 | 0.9 | / | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0.6 | 1 | 0.9 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0.1 |

**NOTE**_**: The above can be used for references. Though having said that, this table is yet to be standardized, and socred better with mathematical inferences.**_
