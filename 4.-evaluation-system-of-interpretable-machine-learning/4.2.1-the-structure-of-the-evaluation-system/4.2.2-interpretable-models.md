# 4.2.1 Interpretable Models\(Model specific\)

The easiest way to achieve interpretability is to use only a subset of algorithms that create interpretable models. We use these interpretable models to evaluate the explainability of the model. So, we came up with these metric systems, which would help us evaluate and diagnose the explainability of the model.

The metric and their subsystem are as below. The definition and further explanations for each follows.

* **Explanation Methods**
* **Method Properties**

Each method above is further bifurcated to individual metrics as given below:

| Explanation Methods | Method Properties |
| :--- | :--- |
| Transparent | Linearity |
| Parametric | Monotonicity |
| Algorithmic complexity | Interaction |

### 4.2.2.1 Explanation Methods

We want to explain the predictions of a machine learning model. To achieve this, we rely on some explanation method, which is an algorithm that generates explanations. **An explanation usually relates the feature values of an instance to its model prediction in a humanly understandable way.** Other types of explanations consist of a set of data instances 

**Definitions:**

* **Transparent:** A model is transparent if we can explain the inner operation of the model based on it's training. 
* **Parametric:** If a model uses its inner parameters to explain it's results, it is considered to be Parametric
* **Algorithmic Complexity:** It is closely related to the time complexity of a machine learning algorithm. ex:  **Time complexity** for GLMs: if N = \# of observations \(usually \# of rows\), and p = \# of variables \(usually \# of columns\), it is `O(p^3 + Np^3)` for most standard **GLM** algorithms.

### 4.2.2.2 Method Properties

Method properties would help us explain about a model's association between features and target. 

* **Linearity:** A model is linear if the association between features and the target is modeled linearly. 
* **Monotonicity:** A model with monotonicity constraints ensures that the relationship between a feature and the target outcome always goes in the same direction over the entire range of the feature: An increase in the feature value either always leads to an increase or always to a decrease in the target outcome. Monotonicity is useful for the interpretation of a model because it makes it easier to understand a relationship. 
* **Interaction:** Some models can automatically include interactions between features to predict the target outcome. You can include interactions in any type of model by manually creating interaction features. Interactions can improve predictive performance, but too many or too complex interactions can hurt interpretability. 

Some models handle only regression, some only classification, and still others both.

From this table, you can select a suitable interpretable model for your task, either regression \(regress\) or classification \(class\):

| Algorithm | Linear | Monotone | Interaction | Task |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Linear regression | Yes | Yes | No | regress |
| Logistic regression | No | Yes | No | class |
| Decision trees | No | Some | Yes | class, regress |
